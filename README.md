# Unicorn-Hat-Mini Games

This repo contains some basic games for the unicorn hat mini.
- The app contains a menu buttons pressed are registered at the main app level and passed to the menu and the running games.
- A reaction game with different levels of difficulty
- Mazes to be solved with different levels of difficulty
- Some other demos and test
- Animations during games

Some important button combinations:

In Menu:  
*A - enter*  
*B - back*  
*X - up*  
*Y - down*  

In Games:  
Depends on the game, but in every Game -> **_Long press A+B+X+Y_ - Exit Game**

For the installation see the `install.sh`.

The app is tested on an old version of Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi ZW.

It would not be hard to change the menu and att new games. 
Check out the tests to get a better idea how it works.
